dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

We will work with the PIMA Indians dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient 
will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of
pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target 
value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a 
value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes.


# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Create training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.4,random_state=42)

# Instantiate a k-NN classifier: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 6)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test data: y_pred
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Generate the confusion matrix and classification report
print(confusion_matrix(y_test,y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test,y_pred))
